# My Cybersecurity Portfolio

## 1. About Me
I am currently pursuing Master of Cybersecurity in University of Malaya with a focus on network defense and automation. My passion lies in creating topologies, configuring real devices (physical or in GNS3) as well as combining network engineering with Python scripting to create active defense tools and vulnerability analyzers similiar to SOAR. This passion laid its foundation when I was studying my Degree (also in University of Malaya) where a course was introduced "Network Technology Foundation", teaching basic routing and configurations.

## 2. Technical Skills
* **Networking**: Cisco Packet Tracer (VLSM, OSPF, VLANs, ACLs), Static Routing, GNS3.
* **Programming**: Python (Scapy, Streamlit, Pandas), Jupyter Notebooks.
* **Security Tools**: Kathara, Python Nmap, Shodan API, Wireshark. 
* **Machine Learning**: GANs (CTGAN, CopulaGAN), Network Traffic Classification.
* **Networking Fundamentals**: Protocols, Models, Concepts of Information Assurance, Cryptography.
* **Tools & Environments**: Competent in Windows, MacOS, Linux (Ubuntu & Kali).

## 3. Certifications and Training
* **Academic Qualification: Master of Cybersecurity (University of Malaya)**
* **Cisco CCNAv7: Introduction to Networks (2022)**
* **Cisco CyberOps Associate 1.0 (2026)**
* **Actively Practising on TryHackMe (Offensive, Defensive Security & Penetration Testing**

## 4. Project Experience

### Project A: Active Defense Dashboard with Scapy & Streamlit
* **Objective**: To build a real-time dashboard that monitors live packet volumes and detects potential anomalies.
* **Tools**: Python, Scapy, Nmap, Shodan, Streamlit.
* **Methodology**: Scripted a sniffer using Scapy to capture live traffic, processed the dataframes, and visualized the packet flow dynamically on a dashboard using Streamlit.
* **Outcome**: Successfully created a functional dashboard that updates in real-time without rate limiting.

### Project B: Vulnerability Monitoring Tool
* **Objective**: Develop an analytics tool to monitor IP groups for CVE details.
* **Tools**: Python, Shodan API.
* **Methodology**: Integrated the Shodan API to query specific IP addresses and cross-reference them with the CVE database to identify critical vulnerabilities.
* **Outcome**: Automated the reconnaissance phase for identified network segments.

## 5. Learning Journey
* **Progress**: I have moved from basic networking concepts to complex automation tasks. Mastering VLSM subnetting and OSPF configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer & GNS3 was a key milestone.
* **Challenges**: Initial configuration of GANs for traffic classification was difficult, particularly balancing the generator and discriminator loss. I am improving this by studying more advanced ML/DL models.

## 6. Career Objective
To secure a role as a Network Security Engineer where I can utilize my skills in Python automation and network architecture to harden infrastructure against advanced persistent threats. In order to aid in the process, I aim to obtain industry reccognized certifications such as OSCP or CompTIA.
